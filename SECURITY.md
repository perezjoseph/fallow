# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in fallow, please report it responsibly via [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow/security/advisories/new) instead of opening a public issue.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Any relevant version or configuration information

## Scope

fallow is a static analysis tool that reads source files and `package.json`. It does not execute user code, make network requests, or modify files (except `fallow fix`, which only edits files in the analyzed project).

## Threat model

The primary security boundary is the project root passed via `--root` (or the discovered config's directory). fallow walks files under that root and reads `package.json`, source files, lockfiles, and CI configs found within it.

Config-sourced glob patterns (`entry`, `ignorePatterns`, `dynamicallyLoaded`, `duplicates.ignore`, `health.ignore`, `overrides[].files`, `ignoreExports[].file`, `ignoreCatalogReferences[].consumer`, `boundaries.zones[].{patterns, root, autoDiscover}`) are validated against absolute paths, `..` traversal segments, and invalid glob syntax at config load time. The same validation applies to every glob-bearing field on inline `framework[]` plugin definitions and on external plugin files discovered from `.fallow/plugins/`, root-level `fallow-plugin-*.{toml,json,jsonc}`, or paths listed in the `plugins:` config field, including patterns nested inside `detection` combinators (`all`, `any`). Invalid patterns cause `fallow` to exit with code 2 before walking the filesystem, so a malicious `.fallowrc.json` or plugin file shipped in a PR cannot smuggle absolute or traversal globs into a CI run. See issue [#463](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow/issues/463) for the original report.

On `fallow-rs/fallow`'s own GitHub Actions setup, the `approval_policy: first_time_contributors` setting requires maintainer approval before a first-time contributor's PR runs CI, which further narrows the realistic attack window. Self-hosted forks should configure a similar approval policy when running `fallow` on untrusted PR content.

## Binary distribution and verification

Every fallow release publishes per-platform CLI, LSP, and MCP binaries via three channels (the GitHub Release, the `@fallow-cli/*` npm platform packages, and the bundled `fallow-rs/fallow@v2` GitHub Action). At release time the `build` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` signs each binary with the workflow's Ed25519 private key (`ED25519_BINARY_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` repo secret), uploads the resulting `.sig` files alongside the binaries, and publishes npm tarballs with `npm publish --provenance --ignore-scripts`. The same workflow computes a SHA-256 digest of every platform binary and writes it into the platform package's `package.json` under a `fallowDigests` field, so verification on every consumer runs locally without a network round-trip.

The matching public key is `34 bytes of SPKI DER header + 32 raw bytes of Ed25519 public key`. The 32-byte raw key is hardcoded into every consumer (the VS Code extension at `editors/vscode/src/download.ts`, the npm wrapper at `npm/fallow/scripts/verify-binary.js`) so the Ed25519 layer of verification works fully offline and cannot be silently downgraded by network-path tampering. The SHA-256 layer reads the embedded `fallowDigests` field from the platform package's `package.json`; platform packages predating v2.78.1 (which introduced the field, see issue #597) cannot be lazily verified and surface an actionable `npm install fallow@latest` error.

On the npm wrapper specifically, verification runs at first-invocation of `fallow`, `fallow-lsp`, or `fallow-mcp` rather than during `npm install`'s postinstall hook. A small JSON sentinel file is written next to the platform binary (or under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fallow/sentinels/` if the platform pkg dir is read-only, e.g. yarn PnP, Docker baked layers) so subsequent invocations skip verification on a cache hit. The sentinel is bound to both the resolved platform-package directory AND a SHA-256 of each binary's bytes. The directory binding prevents cross-install sentinel reuse in the shared fallback cache (two installs of the same package version on the same host cannot ride each other's verified state). The byte binding catches a tampered binary that happens to preserve the recorded mtime, since the cache hit re-reads the binary and compares its SHA-256 against the sentinel before trusting it. This change preserves the cryptographic property bit-for-bit while removing the dependency on npm install scripts ahead of [npm RFC 868](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/868) (`npm/cli#9360`) Phase 2, which will block postinstall hooks unless consumers explicitly add fallow to their `package.json#allowScripts`. The GitHub Action installer runs its own independent verification step that does not depend on the npm wrapper's first-run path.

### Verification surfaces

| Channel | When verification runs | What it verifies | Failure mode |
|:--------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| VS Code extension | After downloading the binary from the GitHub Release | Ed25519 signature over the binary bytes; SHA-256 fallback when no `.sig` is present | Refuses to launch and deletes the partial download |
| `fallow`, `fallow-lsp`, `fallow-mcp` first invocation | On first run after install or upgrade, cached via a sentinel file next to the platform binary (or in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fallow/sentinels/` when the platform pkg dir is read-only) | Ed25519 signature over each of `fallow`, `fallow-lsp`, `fallow-mcp` in the resolved `@fallow-cli/<platform>` package, then SHA-256 of the binary bytes against the platform package's `fallowDigests` field | Refuses to exec the binary, prints `fallow: binary verification failed: ...` with a specific failure code (`sig-invalid`, `digest-mismatch`, `binary-missing`, `sig-missing`, `digest-unavailable`), exits 1 |
| `fallow --version` | On every invocation (already runs the lazy verify path) | Adds a trailing `verified: yes (<sentinel-path>)` / `verified: skipped (<reason>)` line so procurement teams and CI scripts can confirm the integrity posture in one command | Prints `verified: no (<code>)` and exits 1 |
| `fallow-rs/fallow@v2` GitHub Action installer | After `npm install -g --ignore-scripts fallow@<spec>` | Same as above, but the verifier code is loaded from the checked-out Action tree rather than the installed package so a tampered installer cannot self-validate | Aborts the action step with a `::error::` annotation |
| `npm install fallow` (`postinstall`) | **REMOVED 2026-Q2.** Previously aborted the install on verification failure. Removed for [npm RFC 868](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/868) (`npm/cli#9360`) readiness: Phase 2 of the RFC will block postinstall hooks by default unless consumers add fallow to their `package.json#allowScripts`, which would silently no-op the install-time check. The cryptographic property is preserved bit-for-bit by the lazy first-run path (row above). | n/a (no longer runs) |

The lazy first-run model is stronger than the npm-tarball-shasum-only baseline used by most Rust/Go npm wrappers (esbuild verifies SHA-256 only on its HTTP fallback path; biome, oxlint, rolldown, turbo, rspack, swc, and tailwindcss-oxide ship no in-package binary verification). fallow's Ed25519 signature check uses a key the project controls; provenance attestations from `npm publish --provenance` and the npm registry shasum are complementary signals, not the trust root.

### Out-of-band verification recipe

To verify a binary manually, download both the binary and its `.sig` from a GitHub Release (e.g. `fallow-aarch64-apple-darwin` + `fallow-aarch64-apple-darwin.sig`) and run the workflow's verification script with the public key set in env:

```sh
ED25519_BINARY_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY=g05v13Mz5u7fd5NHxxCstAPS2CNNVZ9e18h+VSreC9E= \
  node .github/scripts/verify-binary.mjs fallow-aarch64-apple-darwin fallow-aarch64-apple-darwin.sig
```

The base64 form of the public key above (`g05v13Mz5u7fd5NHxxCstAPS2CNNVZ9e18h+VSreC9E=`) decodes to the same 32 bytes shown in the fingerprint section.

For the SHA-256 half, compare the local binary hash with the digest embedded in the matching `@fallow-cli/<platform>` package's `package.json`:

```sh
shasum -a 256 node_modules/@fallow-cli/linux-x64-gnu/fallow
node -p 'require("@fallow-cli/linux-x64-gnu/package.json").fallowDigests.fallow'
```

Both lines should print the same hex digest (the second carries a `sha256:` prefix). For platform packages published before v2.78.1 that do not yet ship `fallowDigests`, compare against the GitHub Release asset digest instead:

```sh
gh release view v2.76.0 --repo fallow-rs/fallow --json assets \
  --jq '.assets[] | select(.name=="fallow-aarch64-apple-darwin") | .digest'
```

### The `FALLOW_SKIP_BINARY_VERIFY` escape hatch

Set `FALLOW_SKIP_BINARY_VERIFY=1` (or `true` or `yes`) in the environment to skip Ed25519 and SHA-256 verification at first-run inside `fallow`, `fallow-lsp`, `fallow-mcp` and during the GitHub Action installer step. This emits a warning so the skip is visible in CI logs and lands as a `verified: skipped (FALLOW_SKIP_BINARY_VERIFY is set)` line in `fallow --version` output.

**Enterprise audit-log note.** Setting `FALLOW_SKIP_BINARY_VERIFY=1` at the organization or container level (Docker base image, Kubernetes ConfigMap, org-wide CI variable) silences binary verification for every consumer downstream. Record the rationale in your supply-chain audit trail before doing so. The `verified: skipped` line in `fallow --version` output is the recommended evidence channel for vendor questionnaires.

Use this ONLY when you deliberately replace the published binary, for example:

- You build fallow from source and patch the binary into the platform package after install.
- You mirror npm through a private registry that re-signs or repacks artifacts.
- You run fallow inside an airgapped environment with a locally-built binary.

Do NOT set this flag in regular CI configurations or on machines that are expected to consume the upstream release. An attacker who can set environment variables on your install host can use the same flag to bypass verification; the flag exists for legitimate replacement workflows, not as a noise-reducer.

### Reporting binary tampering

If `npm install fallow` or the `fallow-rs/fallow` action ever aborts with `binary verification failed` on a fresh, unmodified install, do not ignore it. Report it via the [private vulnerability reporting link](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow/security/advisories/new) above and include the full error message and the platform package version. False positives on this path are rare; a sustained failure on a clean install is treated as a P0 supply-chain incident.
