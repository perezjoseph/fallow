//! Regenerate `docs/output-schema.json` from the Rust source of truth.

//! Built only when the `schema-emit` cargo feature is active. Pulls
//! `schemars::JsonSchema` derives off the result and duplication types and

//! Usage:
//! ```bash
//! cargo run -p fallow-cli --features schema-emit --bin fallow-schema-emit \
//!     > docs/output-schema.json
//! ```
//!
//! Today this emits only the `definitions` block that can be derived from the
//! in-scope structs (`AnalysisResults`, all per-finding types in
//! `crates/types/src/results.rs`, `DuplicationReport` and friends in
//! `crates/core/src/duplicates/types.rs`). Hand-written sections of

//! codeclimate/review envelopes, and the health subtree) are merged in from
