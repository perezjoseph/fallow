//! Typed envelope structs for the JSON output contract.
//!
//! Each top-level fallow command (`check`, `dupes`, `health`, `audit`,
//! `explain`, `coverage setup`, plus the bare combined invocation and the
//! CodeClimate / review-envelope side outputs) emits a distinct envelope
//! shape. This module is the schema-side source of truth for those shapes:
//! every type carries `Serialize` plus a cfg-gated `JsonSchema` derive so the
//! committed `docs/output-schema.json` can be regenerated from Rust.
//!
//! Living in `fallow-cli` rather than `fallow-types` because the body fields
//! pull in `DuplicationReport` (from `fallow-core`) and `HealthReport` (from
//! this crate), neither of which is reachable from the lower-level types
//! crate. The shared utility shapes (`SchemaVersion`, `Meta`,
//! `BaselineDeltas`, ...) still live in `fallow_types::envelope` because they
//! depend only on serde primitives.
//!
//! Runtime construction of these envelopes happens in
//! `crates/cli/src/report/json.rs`; the JSON layer builds an envelope struct
//! and converts it to a `serde_json::Value` via `serde_json::to_value`. Path
//! relativisation and the per-finding `actions` injection still run as
//! post-passes on the `Value` tree because they cross result-type boundaries
//! that typed wrappers do not.
//!
//! The CodeClimate (`CodeClimateOutput` + sub-types) and review-envelope
//! (`ReviewEnvelopeOutput` + sub-types) shapes are NOT constructed at
//! runtime today: `crates/cli/src/report/codeclimate.rs` builds CodeClimate
//! issues via a `cc_issue` helper that returns `serde_json::Value`, and the
//! review-envelope renderer (`crates/cli/src/report/ci/review.rs`) builds
//! provider-specific comment payloads via `serde_json::json!`. Migrating
//! those builders is a follow-up; the types here exist so the drift gate
//! can lock the schema shape against Rust source even though the runtime
//! emit is still dynamic.
